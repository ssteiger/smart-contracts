# ATTENTION: This is a work in progress!!

# @dev Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x150b7a02.
# @notice Handle the receipt of an NFT
# @dev The ERC721 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
#      after a `transfer`.
#      This function MAY throw to revert and reject the transfer.
#      Return of other than the magic value MUST result in the transaction
#      being reverted.
# Note: the contract address is always the message sender.
# @param _operator The address which called `safeTransferFrom` function
# @param _from The address which previously owned the token
# @param _tokenId The NFT identifier which is being transferred
# @param _data Additional data with no specified format
# @return `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`
#         unless throwing
# function onERC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) external returns(bytes4);

# EVENTS:

# @dev This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.
#      This event emits when NFTs are created (`from` == 0) and destroyed
#      (`to` == 0).
#      Exception: during contract creation, any number of NFTs  may be created
#      and assigned without emitting Transfer.
#      At the time of any transfer, the approved address for that NFT (if any)
#      is reset to none.

# @dev This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or reaffirmed.
#      The zero address indicates there is no approved address.
#      When a Transfer event emits, this also indicates that the approved
#      address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
