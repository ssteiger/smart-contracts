# EVENTS:

# @dev This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.
# This event emits when NFTs are created (`from` == 0) and destroyed
# (`to` == 0). Exception: during contract creation, any number of NFTs
# may be created and assigned without emitting Transfer. At the time of
# any transfer, the approved address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
Transfer: event({
    _from: indexed(address),
    _to: indexed(address),
    _tokenId: indexed(uint256)

# @dev This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or
# reaffirmed. The zero address indicates there is no approved address.
# When a Transfer event emits, this also indicates that the approved
# address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
Approval: event({
    _owner: indexed(address),
    _approved: indexed(address),

# @dev This emits when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner.
# The operator can manage all NFTs of the owner.

    _approved: indexed(address),
    _approved: bool)
